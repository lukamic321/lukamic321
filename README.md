- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukamic321
- 📱  My Discord handle is: 
- 👀 I’m interested in: JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and maybe learning PHP (but it scares me a little)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, just for fun though. No real job aspriations.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate. As you can tell from the update logs on my own projects, I have very little spare time, and in that spare time I love procrastinating. I should probably work on that before collaborating on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- Email: lukamic321@gmail.com
